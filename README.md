PY TD Game

Make sure to install pygame before running.

Followed along with codewmax but learned a lot about pygame and python. I did change a few more aspects of the game so its not an exact copy but I would like to continue to build different enemies and possibly mutate this into an even more feature dense game. 

I still need to find my own images and clean up how the code looks. Otherwise everything should be in working order!
